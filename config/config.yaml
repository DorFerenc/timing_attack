  # Timing parameters (optimized for speed)
  timing:
    initial_samples: 10      # Samples for first 3 characters (reduced from 20)
    middle_samples: 8        # Samples for chars 4-8 (reduced from 15)
    final_samples: 5         # Samples for chars 9+ (reduced from 10)
    min_samples: 3           # Minimum samples (reduced from 5)

  # Statistical thresholds
  thresholds:
    confidence_level: 0.95   # Statistical confidence
    min_time_difference: 0.001  # Minimum detectable difference (1ms)
    outlier_std_dev: 3       # Standard deviations for outlier removal

# Performance
